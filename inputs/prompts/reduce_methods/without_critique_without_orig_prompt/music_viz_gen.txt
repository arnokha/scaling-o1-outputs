I'm trying to make a music visualization. The base of it will be an image (a picture of a car, for example). I want the image to react to certain qualities of the music.

Think of ways we can make interesting visual effects. Example:
Percussion (bass)
- Detection: ???
- Effect: Image vibration

Here is my current code for generating features and creating a video clip that displays those features:
music_vid_gen.py:
```
{{REFERENCE}}
```
